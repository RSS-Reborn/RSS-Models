### Installation
- Install my Kopernicus fork from [here](https://github.com/ballisticfox/Kopernicus/releases).
- Download from [here]().
- Place the .bin file of the planet you want inside of your RSS-Configs/Cache folder, allow your file manager to overwrite.

To uninstall simply delete the file, the game will regenerate a new low-poly one.

## Technical Information
By default, Kopernicus will only generate extremely low poly models for planets, using blender this can be remedied to provide actual depth to planets that previously looked extremely flat from orbit.

These models do come at the cost of performance.
